# OBMetaProducerNF-1204

Minecraft NeoForged 1.20.4 mod to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
Outputs player position data every 5 seconds for use with player markers on our Overviewer maps for example.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.

Compiled for NeoForged/Minecraft 1.20.4 using Java 17
